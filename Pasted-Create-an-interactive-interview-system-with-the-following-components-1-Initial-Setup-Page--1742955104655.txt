Create an interactive interview system with the following components:

1. **Initial Setup Page**:
   - Fields for:
     * Role/Position (dropdown with common tech roles: Frontend Developer, Backend Developer, Data Scientist, etc.)
     * Job Description (text area for pasting JD)
     * Resume/CV (text area for pasting resume text)
   - "Generate Questions" button that analyzes all inputs and creates tailored questions

2. **Question Generation Logic**:
   - Generate 20 total questions with:
     * 75% focused on job description and required skills/areas
     * 25% on general behavioral/soft skills
   - Questions should be:
     * Technical: Specific to role requirements
     * Scenario-based: "How would you handle X situation?"
     * Problem-solving: "Explain how you would solve X problem"
     * Behavioral: "Tell me about a time when..."

3. **Interview Interface**:
   - Clean, distraction-free interface showing:
     * Question number (1/20)
     * Current question (large text)
     * Text area for answer (with disabled copy/paste functionality)
     * Character counter
     * "Next Question" button
   - Timer showing elapsed time
   - Progress bar

4. **Evaluation System**:
   - After final question:
     * Generate detailed feedback for each answer assessing:
       - Technical accuracy
       - Clarity of communication
       - Relevance to question
       - Demonstrated expertise
     * Provide an overall score (0-100) with breakdown:
       - Technical skills (50%)
       - Problem-solving (30%)
       - Communication (20%)
   - "Download Report" button (PDF/HTML)

5. **Additional Features**:
   - Session persistence (save progress if interrupted)
   - Voice-to-text answer option
   - Accessibility features (font size adjustment, high contrast mode)

Technical Requirements:
- Implement copy/paste prevention in answer fields
- Store interview data temporarily (no permanent storage needed)


Design Guidelines:

- Clear visual hierarchy
- Minimal distractions during interview
